## Achievement 6 Project: Labor Force Participation Rate Project

## Introduction to the Project
The economic gender gap refers to the systematic differences in the outcomes that males and females achieve in the labor market. One of the factors of the gap is labor force participation. The labor force participation rate is the proportion of the population aged 15 and older that is economically active, that is, employed in some way. At the current rate of progress, it will take over 200 years for the gap in the workplace to close. If we can figure out ways to increase the female labor participation rate, we can decrease the gap quicker. The result of this being millions to billions of dollars added to a countries GDP.
